<p>Pam Bayfield's hard-to-bear story By Marj Belessis <a href="../knees-up-mother-brown/knees-up-mother-brown-manly-daily-11-07-2007.html" target="_blank" class="link" title="knees up mother brown manly daily 11-07-2007">Click here to see the article</a>.</p>
<p>Pam knew the book she wrote about her double knee reconstruction had made the grade when she received an order for a copy from an orthopaedic surgeon in Victoria.</p>
	<p>Mrs Bayfield's book  Knees Up Mother Brown was written and self published in 2005, the year after she had a bilateral replacement of both knees. The Elanora Heights grandma's wart'n'all account of the operation (sometimes painful) recovery, based on a detailed account she kept of the experience up to three months post-op and monthly progress reports therafter, wasn't intended for light bedtime reading.</p>
	<p>Rather it was done to encourage others with gammy knees to consider the surgical option and reassure those who have had the operation but still getting over it that there is light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
	<p>"It seems to have done the job," the author said this week. "I've just about sold out from the first print run and I've ordered another run. I receive lots of feedback from people who say it was a big help but the biggest thrill was receiving an order from the orthopaedic surgeon in Victoria. I liked the idea that a doctor was going to find out what pain and agony we patients go through to get new knees."</p>
