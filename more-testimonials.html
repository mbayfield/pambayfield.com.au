Hi Pam
<br /><br />
Thank you for sending me a copy of your book.  I hadn't told you before but I am Sue Steggalls sister.  We obviously live in the country (as you would know from my address) sos do not get to Sydney that much but talk to Sue very often.
<br /><br />
I bought the book for a f riend of mine whose husband has just had both knees done and he is through and through a country man.  He has been a very good camp drafter and just about lives on his horse - so as you can imagine he is very frustrated.  He had the operation about 4 weeks and this last week really feels that he is getting somewhere on top of it all.  His wife has started reading the book and has found it to be minute by minute accurate - so congrats to that.  I am looking forward to reading it as well (even none of my family have had knee operations although my husband was a very good rugby player in his youth and is now probably paying the price with his knees so you never know we may need that book as well!!!!!!!!!.  My friend who is reading it at the moment had her hip replacement by the same Dr. as you so she was very excited about that.
<br /><br />
Anyway well done and thank you again,<br />
Cheers<br />
Ann Dent<br />
