<p><strong>Book Review</strong></p>


<p>(This review has been published at Pittwater Life Magazine early in 2011)</p>
<p>Local author Pam Bayfield is indefatigable. This is her eighth self-published book, this time the memoirs of Julien and Paula Vanslambrouck.</p>
<p>She combined them into one fascinating story of two very different people whose lives reflect a
whole era of Australian society.</p>
<p>Julien was a young Dutch boy hiding from the Nazis as his story begins. Fired with a yen for
adventure he travelled to Australia. Taking any job he could and moving round the country his
life reflects the post-war migrant experience.</p>
<p>In New Guinea he met his future wife. Paula was one of nine children who grew up in
Wauchope in the poverty of the Depression.</p>
<p>She too yearned to escape and better herself. After their marriage the couple, through hard
work and enterprise became a success story, Julian as an international manager for a major
corporation. They raised a family and became stalwarts of various communities where they
lived.</p>
<p>The book will be launched by Stuart Wagstaff with Bronwyn Bishop as a special guest at the
RSL Village Narrabeen on May 19th. Call Carolyn Walden on 8978 4244 for details. It will be
sold at Dymocks at Warringah Mall and Berkelouw Books at Mona Vale.</p>
